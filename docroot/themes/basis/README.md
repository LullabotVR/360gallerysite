# Basis Theme
Candidate for new default theme in Backdrop.

#### Don't use this theme in a real project yet
This is currently in alpha and is likely to see major changes.

#### Feel free to create issues!
I'd love to get any feedback, features, or issues anyone has while messing around with theme.

### In this version:
* Site design is made to work well in the one column layout, will add support for other layouts soon
* Lots of features added that need fallbacks for older browsers, e.g. lots of flexbox that won't work in old IE
* Themed everything needed for homepage
* Themed most elements that appear on the styleguide
* Overrode default layout to add a max-content width but have colored bands that stretched across the page
* Added static markup for elements that were used on homepage
* Added @todo comments for things that I need to go back and fix
